# Pull From OCI Registry

Cuestomize can fetch CUE modules directly from an OCI registry (such as Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry). This allows you to share and reuse CUE logic across projects and teams, and makes distributing your CUE models easier.

To pull a CUE module from an OCI registry, specify the `remoteModule` field in your Cuestomize KRM configuration.

Both public and private registries are supported.
