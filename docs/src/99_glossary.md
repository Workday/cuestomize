# Glossary

- **Cuestomize**: both the KRM function and the binary that gets executed in the container.
- **CUE model**: it is a CUE-lang module that bundles the manifest generation logic. It is expected to have an `outputs` field which is a slice of KRM resources, and optionally an `input` field and an `includes` field (see [CUE Model Integration](./02_cue_model_integration.md) for more details).
- **Unified CUE model**: the result of merging the CUE model with the input values and resources forwarded from the Kustomize input stream.
- **Inputs**: the data that is passed to the CUE model via the `input` field of the function's specification.
- **Includes**: resources that are passed to the CUE model via the `includes` field of the function's specification. These resources are taken from the Kustomize input stream.
- **Outputs**: the resources generated by the CUE model and passed back to Kustomize.
